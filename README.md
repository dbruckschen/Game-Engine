Rudimentary Multimedia Library is a low level programming library for graphics, audio, text etc. with a solely educational purpose in mind.
The goal is to understand various aspects of game development and systems programming in general in a low level way.
That's why rendering is done in software and functions from standard librarys are implemented myself.

The motto is reinvent the wheel as much as possible. 

I'm aware that much code, if not all of it, is messy, error prone or not fully implemented, but where is the fun in including someone else's code? :P
