Rudimentary Multimedia Library is a low level programming library for graphics, audio, text etc. with a solely educational purpose in mind.
The goal is to understand various aspects of game development and systems programming in general in a low level way.
That's why rendering is done in software and many functions, which could be included from well known librarys, are implemented myself.

I'm aware that much code, if not all of it, is messy, error prone or not fully implemented, but where is the fun in including someone else's code? :P
